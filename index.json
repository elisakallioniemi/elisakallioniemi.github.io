TMS-EEG is particularly unique compared with other available neurophysiological methods, as it can measure the state and dynamics of excitatory and inhibitory systems separately. Because of these capabilities, TMS-EEG responses are sensitive to the brain state, and the responses are influenced by brain maturation and ageing, making TMS-EEG a suitable method to study age-specific pathophysiology. In this review, we outline the TMS-EEG measurement procedure, the existing methods used for characterising TMS-EEG responses and the challenges associated with identifying the responses. We also summarise the findings thus far on how TMS-EEG responses change across the lifespan and the TMS-EEG features that separate typical and atypical brain maturation and ageing. Finally, we give an overview of the gaps in current knowledge to provide directions for future studies.","tags":[],"title":"TMS-EEG responses across the lifespan: Measurement, methods for characterisation and identified responses","type":"publication"},{"authors":["Z.

Another seizure therapy under development is magnetic seizure therapy (MST), which could potentially overcome the restrictions associated with ECT with similar efficacy. The neurophysiological targets and mechanisms of seizure therapy, however, remain poorly understood.\n**Methods/design**: This neurophysiological study protocol is published as a companion to the overall Confirmatory Efficacy and Safety Trial of Magnetic Seizure Therapy for Depression (CREST-MST) protocol that describes our two-site, double-blind, randomized, non-inferiority clinical trial to develop MST as an effective and safe treatment for TRD. Our aim for the neurophysiological component of the study is to evaluate two biomarkers, one to predict remission of suicidal ideation (primary outcome) and the other to predict cognitive impairment (secondary outcome). Suicidal ideation will be assessed through cortical inhibition, which according to our preliminary studies, correlates with remission of suicidal ideation. Cortical inhibition will be measured with simultaneous transcranial magnetic stimulation (TMS) and electroencephalography (EEG), TMS-EEG, which measures TMS-evoked EEG activity. Cognitive adverse effects associated with seizure therapy, on the contrary, will be evaluated via multiscale entropy analysis reflecting the complexity of ongoing resting-state EEG activity.\n**Discussion**: ECT and MST are known to influence cortical inhibition associated with depression, suicidal ideation severity, and clinical outcome. Therefore, evaluating cortical inhibition and brain temporal dynamics will help understand the pathophysiology of depression and suicidal ideation and define new biological targets that could aid clinicians in diagnosing and selecting treatments. Resting-state EEG complexity was previously associated with the degree of cognitive side effects after a seizure therapy. This neurophysiological metric may help clinicians assess the risk for adverse effects caused by these useful and effective treatments.

In this study, we observed that heavy drinking from adolescence to young adulthood was associated with altered volumes of cerebellar lobules. The study included two groups consisting of 33 heavy-drinking and 25 light-drinking participants. The heavy-drinking participants were highly functional young adults without alcohol use disorder, but with a history of regular heavy alcohol consumption. The participants were 13-18 years old at baseline and were followed for ten years. At the age of 21-28 years, the participants underwent magnetic resonance imaging (MRI). From the MR images, the cerebellum was segmented into 12 lobules using the CERES pipeline. Heavy drinking did not influence the absolute cerebellar volume, but changes were observed in posterior cerebellar lobules associated with motor and cognitive functions. The absolute volume (p = 0.038) and gray matter volume (p = 0.034) of Crus II (hemispheres combined) were smaller in the heavy-drinking group. Furthermore, the relative volume of the right VIIIB lobule was larger in the HD group (p = 0.036). However, there were no differences in the absolute right VIIIB volumes (p = 0.198) between the groups.

The exact location of the hotspot is difficult to determine, and the spatial extent of high-amplitude MEPs usually remains undefined due to MEP variability and the spread of the TMS-induced electric field (E-field). Therefore, here we aim to define the hotspot as a sub-region of a motor map. **New method**: We analyzed MEP amplitude distributions in motor mappings of 30 healthy subjects in two orthogonal directions on the motor cortex. Based on the widths of these distributions, the hotspot extent was estimated as an elliptic area. In addition, E-field distributions induced by motor map edge stimulations were simulated for ten subjects, and the E-field attenuation was analyzed to obtain another estimate for hotspot extent. **Results**: The median MEP-based hotspot area was 13 mm² (95% confidence interval (CI) = [10, 18] mm²). The mean E-field-based hotspot area was 26 mm² (95% CI = [13, 38] mm²). **Comparison with existing methods**: In contrast to the conventional hotspot, the new definition considers its spatial extent, indicating the most easily excited area where subsequent nTMS stimuli should be targeted for maximal response. The E-field-based hotspot provides an estimate for the extent of cortical structures where the E-field is close to its maximum. **Conclusions**: The nTMS hotspot should be considered as an area rather than a single qualitatively defined spot due to MEP variability and E-field spread.","tags":null,"title":"Spatial extent of cortical motor hotspot in navigated transcranial magnetic stimulation","type":"publication"},{"authors":["T.

MEPs were recorded from the first dorsal interosseous muscle following navigated TMS focused at the primary motor cortex. The PCR holding of at least 96% of total variance of the MEP dataset was performed to parameterize MEPs into principal components (PCs), which were used with non-linear least square estimation to reconstruct original MEPs. The comparison between the original and reconstructed MEPs showed that PCs, which accounted for 96% of total variance, were able to characterize the MEP morphology, i.e., the PCR summarizes the repeated information in the MEP dataset into the PC set. In addition, PCR benefited the automated quantification of MEP features as it removed the random noise caused by the environmental interference and the inconsistency of neuronal pathways. Furthermore, we could determine the minimum number of trials required to reliably represent the whole dataset by estimating the partial information of those trials accounted for. Our results showed that this partial information exponentially increased with respect to the number of trials, and saturated within 20 MEPs holding approximately 90% of total variance of the dataset.","tags":null,"title":"Principal Component Regression on Motor Evoked Potential in Single-Pulse Transcranial Magnetic Stimulation","type":"publication"},{"authors":["C.

Noninvasive neuromodulation therapies are one such therapeutic category; they typically involve the transcranial application of electrical or magnetic stimulation to modulate cortical and subcortical brain activity. Although electroconvulsive therapy (ECT) has been used since the 1930s, with the prevalence of major depressive disorder and treatment-resistant depression (TRD), the past three decades have seen a proliferation of noninvasive neuromodulation antidepressant therapeutic development. The purpose of this critical review was to synthesize information regarding the clinical effects, neurocognitive effects, and possible mechanisms of action of noninvasive neuromodulation therapies, including ECT, transcranial magnetic stimulation, magnetic seizure therapy, and transcranial direct current stimulation. Considerable research has provided substantial information regarding their antidepressant and neurocognitive effects, but their mechanisms of action remain unknown. Although the four therapies vary in how they modulate neurocircuitry and their resultant antidepressant and neurocognitive effects, they are nonetheless useful for patients with acute and chronic major depressive disorder and TRD. Continued research is warranted to inform dosimetry, algorithm for administration, and integration among the noninvasive neuromodulation therapies and with other antidepressant strategies to continue to maximize their safety and antidepressant benefit.","tags":["review"],"title":"Critical Review and Synthesis of Clinical and Neurocognitive Effects of Noninvasive Neuromodulation Antidepressant Therapies","type":"publication"},{"authors":["S.

Usually, single TMS pulses are targeted to the motor cortex with the help of neuronavigation and by measuring motor evoked potential (MEP) amplitudes from the peripheral muscles. The efficacy of single-pulse TMS to induce MEPs has been shown to increase by applying facilitatory paired-pulse TMS (ppTMS). Therefore, the aim was to study whether the facilitatory ppTMS could enable more efficient motor mapping. Biphasic single-pulse TMS and ppTMS with inter-stimulus intervals (ISIs) of 1.4 and 2.8 ms were applied to measure resting motor thresholds (rMTs) as a percentage of the maximal stimulator output and to determine the cortical representation areas of the right first dorsal interosseous muscle in healthy volunteers. The areas, shapes, hotspots, and center of gravities (CoGs) of the representations were calculated. Biphasic ppTMS with ISI of 1.4 ms resulted in lower rMTs than those obtained with the other protocols (p = 0.001). With ISI of 2.8 ms, rMT was lower than with single-pulse TMS (p = 0.032). The ppTMS mapping was thus performed with lower intensity than when using single-pulse TMS. The areas, shapes, hotspots, and CoGs of the muscle representations were in agreement. Hence, biphasic ppTMS has potential in the mapping of cortical hand representations in healthy individuals as an alternative for single-pulses, but with lower stimulation intensity by utilizing cortical facilitatory mechanism. This could improve application of nTMS in subjects with low motor tract excitability.","tags":null,"title":"Efficient Mapping of the Motor Cortex with Navigated Biphasic Paired-Pulse Transcranial Magnetic Stimulation","type":"publication"},{"authors":["O.

The arousal reaction is known to originate from the ascending reticular activating system of the brain stem and to modulate neuronal activity throughout the central nervous system. In this study we investigated the difference in motor evoked potentials (MEPs) when deviant and novelty stimuli were randomly interspersed in a train of standard tones. Twelve healthy subjects participated in this study. Three types of sound stimuli were used: 1) standard stimuli (800 Hz), 2) deviant stimuli (560 Hz), and 3) novelty stimuli (12 different sounds). In each stimulus sequence 600 stimuli were given. Of these, 90 were deviant stimuli randomly placed between the standard stimuli. Each of 12 novel sounds was presented once in pseudorandomized order. TMS was randomly mixed with the sound stimuli so that it was either synchronized with the individual N100 or trailed the sound onset by 200 ms. All sounds elicited an increase in motor cortex excitability. The type of sound had no significant effect. We also demonstrated that TMS timed at 200-ms intervals caused a significant increment of MEPs.

RS is considered to be related to neural processing of external stimuli. We hypothesized that this neural processing is progressively impaired in EPM1 from adolescence to adulthood. Eight adult patients with EPM1 (age: 40 ± 13 yr), six adolescent patients with EPM1 (age: 16 ± 1 yr), and ten adult controls (age: 35 ± 12 yr) were studied using navigated TMS and RS study protocol including trains of four repeated stimuli with intertrain interval of 20 s and interstimulus interval of 1 s. Changes in RS were investigated from adolescence to adulthood in EPM1 by comparing with adult controls. In controls, the RS was seen as 50-55% reduction in motor response amplitudes to TMS after the first stimulus. RS was mild or missing in EPM1. RS from first to second stimulus within the stimulus trains was significantly stronger in adolescent patients than in adult patients ( P = 0.046). Abnormal RS correlated with the myoclonus severity of the patients. In agreement with our hypothesis, neural processing of external stimuli is progressively impaired in EPM1 possibly due to anatomically impaired thalamocortical system or inhibitory tonus preventing sufficient adaptive reactiveness to stimuli.

Combining simultaneous electroencephalogram (EEG) recording with transcranial magnetic stimulation (TMS) enables direct, in vivo exploration of cortical excitability and assessment of effective and functional connectivity.

However, no previous studies have examined the effects of long-term alcohol use in adolescence on TEPs. In this study, a total of 27 young adults with heavy alcohol use in adolescence and 25 age-matched, gender-matched and education-matched controls with little or no alcohol use participated in TMS-EEG measurements.

However, the cortex is affected by a broad E-field distribution, which tends to broaden estimates of representation areas by stimulating also the neighboring areas in addition to the maximum E-field location. Our aim was to improve the estimation of nTMS-based motor maps by taking into account the E-field distribution of the stimulation pulse. The effect of the E-field distribution was considered by calculating the minimum-norm estimate (MNE) of the motor representation area. We tested the method on simulated data and then applied it to recordings from six healthy volunteers and one stroke patient. We compared the motor representation areas obtained with the MNE method and a previously introduced interpolation method. The MNE hotspots and centers of gravity were close to those obtained with the interpolation method. The areas of the maps, however, depend on the thresholds used for outlining the areas.

GABAergic intracortical inhibition, known to be affected by stroke lesion, was also investigated. **METHODS**: Eight patients exhibiting little or no motor impairment were studied using transcranial magnetic stimulation (TMS) and diffusion weighted imaging (DWI) 15months from diagnosis. Resting motor threshold (MT) for 50μV and 2mV motor evoked potentials, and short-interval intracortical inhibition (SICI) were measured from hand muscles. Apparent diffusion coefficients (ADCs) were analyzed from the DWI for the primary motor cortex (M1), the supplementary motor area (SMA) and thalamus for reflecting changes in neuronal organization. **RESULTS**: The MTs did not differ between the affected (AH) and unaffected hemisphere (UH) in 50μV responses, while the MTs for 2mV responses were higher (p=0.018) in AH. SICI was weakened in AH (p=0.008). ADCs were higher in the affected M1 compared to the unaffected M1 (p=0.018) while there were no inter-hemispheric differences in SMA or thalamus. **CONCLUSIONS**: Inter-hemispheric asymmetry and neuronal organization demonstrated abnormalities in the M1. However, no confident inference can be made whether the observed alterations in neurophysiological and imaging measures have causal role for motor rehabilitation in these patients. **SIGNIFICANCE**: Neurophysiological changes persist and are detectable using TMS years after stroke even though clinical symptoms have normalized.","tags":null,"title":"Functional and structural cortical characteristics after restricted focal motor cortical infarction evaluated at chronic stage - Indications from a preliminary study","type":"publication"},{"authors":["E.

The responses are affected by the orientation of the stimulated neurons with respect to the direction of the TMS-induced electric field. Therefore, besides being a functional imaging tool, TMS may potentially assess the local structural properties. Yet, TMS has not been used for this purpose. **NEW METHOD**: A novel principle to evaluate the relation between function and structure of the motor cortex is presented. This functional anisotropy is evaluated by an anisotropy index (AI), based on motor evoked potential amplitudes induced with different TMS coil orientations, i.e. different electric field directions at a cortical target. To compare the AI with anatomical anisotropy in an explorative manner, diffusion tensor imaging-derived fractional anisotropy (FA) was estimated at different depths near the stimulation site. **RESULTS**:  AI correlated inversely with cortical excitability through the TMS-induced electric field at motor threshold level. Further, there was a trend of negative correlation between AI and FA. **COMPARISON WITH EXISTING METHODS**:  None of the existing methods alone can detect the relationship between direct motor cortex activation and local neuronal structure. **CONCLUSIONS**:  The AI appears to provide information on the functional neuronal anisotropy of the motor cortex by coupling neurophysiology and neuroanatomy within the stimulated cortical region. The AI could prove useful in the evaluation of neurological disorders and traumas involving concurrent structural and functional changes in the motor cortex. Further studies on patients are needed to confirm the usability of AI.","tags":null,"title":"Functional neuronal anisotropy assessed with neuronavigated transcranial magnetic stimulation","type":"publication"},{"authors":["E.

RS has been reported to occur in the resting motor-evoked potentials (MEPs) with respect to the first pulse in a train of stimuli.

According to the principles of electromagnetism and electrophysiology, TMS activates those neurons that are suitably oriented with respect to the TMS-induced electric field. We hypothesized that TMS could potentially be able to evaluate the neuronal structure, although until now, this putative application has not been exploited. We have developed a TMS-based method to evaluate the function and structure of the motor cortex concurrently in a quantitative manner. This method produced a measure, the anisotropy index (AI), which is based on the motor-evoked potentials induced at different coil orientations. The AI was demonstrated to exhibit an association with both motor cortex excitability and neuronal structure. In the present study, we evaluated the repeatability (intrasession and intersession) of AI in three consecutive measurements. In addition, we studied the repeatability of the optimal coil angle in inducing motor-evoked potentials. Two of the measurements were conducted on the same stimulation target and the third on a remapped target. The coefficient of repeatability of the AI was 0.022 for intrasession and 0.040 for intersession assessments. For the optimal stimulation angle, the coefficients of repeatability were 3.7° and 5.1°, respectively. Both the AI and the optimal stimulation angle demonstrated good repeatability (Cronbach's α0.760). In conclusion, the results indicate that the AI can provide a reliable estimation of local functional anisotropy changes under conditions affecting the cortex, such as during stroke or focal dysplasia.","tags":null,"title":"Repeatability of functional anisotropy in navigated transcranial magnetic stimulation--coil-orientation versus response","type":"publication"},{"authors":["E.

The MEP latency, which is a more stable parameter than the MEP amplitude, has not so far been utilized in motor mapping. The latency, however, may provide information about the stress in damaged motor pathways, e.g. compression by tumors, which cannot be observed from the MEP amplitudes. Thus, inclusion of this parameter could add valuable information to the presently used technique of MEP amplitude mapping. In this study, the functional cortical representations of first dorsal interosseous (FDI), abductor pollicis brevis (APB) and abductor digiti minimi (ADM) muscles were mapped in both hemispheres of ten healthy righthanded volunteers. The cortical muscle representations were evaluated by the area and centre of gravity (CoG) by using MEP amplitudes and latencies. As expected, the latency and amplitude CoGs were congruent and were located in the centre of the maps but in a few subjects, instead of a single centre, several loci with short latencies were observed. In conclusion, MEP latencies may be useful in distinguishing the cortical representation areas with the most direct pathways from those pathways with prolonged latencies. However, the potential of latency mapping to identify stressed motor tract connections at the subcortical level will need to be verified in future studies with patients.","tags":null,"title":"Onset Latency of Motor Evoked Potentials in Motor Cortical Mapping with Neuronavigated Transcranial Magnetic Stimulation","type":"publication"},{"authors":["E.
