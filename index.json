We demonstrated that reactivity to frontal cortex TMS decreases with development. We also showed that although frontal cortex TMS elicits an equally complex TEP waveform in all age groups, the statistically significant between-group differences in the topography of the TMS-evoked peaks and differences in current density maps suggest changes in effective connectivity of the right PMd with maturation.

Usually, single TMS pulses are targeted to the motor cortex with the help of neuronavigation and by measuring motor evoked potential (MEP) amplitudes from the peripheral muscles. The efficacy of single-pulse TMS to induce MEPs has been shown to increase by applying facilitatory paired-pulse TMS (ppTMS). Therefore, the aim was to study whether the facilitatory ppTMS could enable more efficient motor mapping. Biphasic single-pulse TMS and ppTMS with inter-stimulus intervals (ISIs) of 1.4 and 2.8 ms were applied to measure resting motor thresholds (rMTs) as a percentage of the maximal stimulator output and to determine the cortical representation areas of the right first dorsal interosseous muscle in healthy volunteers. The areas, shapes, hotspots, and center of gravities (CoGs) of the representations were calculated. Biphasic ppTMS with ISI of 1.4 ms resulted in lower rMTs than those obtained with the other protocols (p = 0.001). With ISI of 2.8 ms, rMT was lower than with single-pulse TMS (p = 0.032). The ppTMS mapping was thus performed with lower intensity than when using single-pulse TMS. The areas, shapes, hotspots, and CoGs of the muscle representations were in agreement. Hence, biphasic ppTMS has potential in the mapping of cortical hand representations in healthy individuals as an alternative for single-pulses, but with lower stimulation intensity by utilizing cortical facilitatory mechanism. This could improve application of nTMS in subjects with low motor tract excitability.","tags":null,"title":"Efficient Mapping of the Motor Cortex with Navigated Biphasic Paired-Pulse Transcranial Magnetic Stimulation","type":"publication"},{"authors":null,"categories":null,"content":" In this tutorial, I\u0026rsquo;ll share my top 10 tips for getting started with Academic:\nTip 1 \u0026hellip;\nTip 2 \u0026hellip;\n","date":1536469200,"expirydate":-62135596800,"kind":"page","lang":"en","lastmod":1536469200,"objectID":"6a451186c775f5f0adb3a0416d0cb711","permalink":"https://www.elisakallioniemi.com/tutorial/example/","publishdate":"2018-09-09T00:00:00-05:00","relpermalink":"/tutorial/example/","section":"tutorial","summary":"In this tutorial, I\u0026rsquo;ll share my top 10 tips for getting started with Academic:\nTip 1 \u0026hellip;\nTip 2 \u0026hellip;","tags":null,"title":"Example Page","type":"docs"},{"authors":["O.

The arousal reaction is known to originate from the ascending reticular activating system of the brain stem and to modulate neuronal activity throughout the central nervous system. In this study we investigated the difference in motor evoked potentials (MEPs) when deviant and novelty stimuli were randomly interspersed in a train of standard tones. Twelve healthy subjects participated in this study. Three types of sound stimuli were used: 1) standard stimuli (800 Hz), 2) deviant stimuli (560 Hz), and 3) novelty stimuli (12 different sounds). In each stimulus sequence 600 stimuli were given. Of these, 90 were deviant stimuli randomly placed between the standard stimuli. Each of 12 novel sounds was presented once in pseudorandomized order. TMS was randomly mixed with the sound stimuli so that it was either synchronized with the individual N100 or trailed the sound onset by 200 ms. All sounds elicited an increase in motor cortex excitability. The type of sound had no significant effect. We also demonstrated that TMS timed at 200-ms intervals caused a significant increment of MEPs. This contradicted our hypothesis that MEP amplitudes to TMS synchronized with N100 would be greater than those to TMS at 200 ms after a sound and remains unexplained.

The neurophysiological mechanisms behind the impaired thalamocortical system were studied through short-term adaptation of the motor cortex to transcranial magnetic stimulation (TMS) via repetition suppression (RS) phenomenon. RS is considered to be related to neural processing of external stimuli. We hypothesized that this neural processing is progressively impaired in EPM1 from adolescence to adulthood. Eight adult patients with EPM1 (age: 40 ± 13 yr), six adolescent patients with EPM1 (age: 16 ± 1 yr), and ten adult controls (age: 35 ± 12 yr) were studied using navigated TMS and RS study protocol including trains of four repeated stimuli with intertrain interval of 20 s and interstimulus interval of 1 s. Changes in RS were investigated from adolescence to adulthood in EPM1 by comparing with adult controls. In controls, the RS was seen as 50-55% reduction in motor response amplitudes to TMS after the first stimulus. RS was mild or missing in EPM1. RS from first to second stimulus within the stimulus trains was significantly stronger in adolescent patients than in adult patients ( P = 0.046). Abnormal RS correlated with the myoclonus severity of the patients. In agreement with our hypothesis, neural processing of external stimuli is progressively impaired in EPM1 possibly due to anatomically impaired thalamocortical system or inhibitory tonus preventing sufficient adaptive reactiveness to stimuli.

Since rMT is influenced by spinal excitability and coil-to-cortex distance, responses recorded from the cortex, instead of a peripheral muscle, could provide a more accurate marker for cortical excitability.

Combining simultaneous electroencephalogram (EEG) recording with transcranial magnetic stimulation (TMS) enables direct, in vivo exploration of cortical excitability and assessment of effective and functional connectivity. In the central nervous system, the effects of alcohol are particularly mediated by alterations in gamma-aminobutyric acid (GABA)ergic neurotransmission, and TMS-evoked potentials (TEPs) N45 and N100 in EEG are known to reflect GABAergic function. However, no previous studies have examined the effects of long-term alcohol use in adolescence on TEPs. In this study, a total of 27 young adults with heavy alcohol use in adolescence and 25 age-matched, gender-matched and education-matched controls with little or no alcohol use participated in TMS-EEG measurements. The motor cortex (M1) was stimulated with an intensity of 90 percent of the resting motor threshold of the abductor pollicis brevis muscle. No significant differences were found in the resting motor threshold, TEP latencies or neuropsychological functioning between the groups. We observed an increase in the global mean field power in the time window of 54- to 75-millisecond post-TMS, as well as significant topographical differences in the P60 and N100 in those with a history of heavy drinking. Furthermore, there was a marked increase in the GABAergic N45 amplitude in alcohol users.

Conventionally, a cortical location is considered to belong to the motor cortex if the maximum electric field (E-field) targeted there evokes a motor-evoked potential in a muscle. However, the cortex is affected by a broad E-field distribution, which tends to broaden estimates of representation areas by stimulating also the neighboring areas in addition to the maximum E-field location. Our aim was to improve the estimation of nTMS-based motor maps by taking into account the E-field distribution of the stimulation pulse. The effect of the E-field distribution was considered by calculating the minimum-norm estimate (MNE) of the motor representation area. We tested the method on simulated data and then applied it to recordings from six healthy volunteers and one stroke patient. We compared the motor representation areas obtained with the MNE method and a previously introduced interpolation method. The MNE hotspots and centers of gravity were close to those obtained with the interpolation method. The areas of the maps, however, depend on the thresholds used for outlining the areas. The MNE method may improve the definition of cortical motor areas, but its accuracy should be validated by comparing the results with maps obtained with direct cortical stimulation of the cortex where the E-field distribution can be better focused.","tags":null,"title":"Minimum-Norm Estimation of Motor Representations in Navigated TMS Mappings","type":"publication"},{"authors":["S.

To elucidate the neurophysiological hallmarks of motor cortex development, we investigated the differences in motor cortical excitability and connectivity between healthy children, adolescents, and adults by means of navigated suprathreshold motor cortex transcranial magnetic stimulation (TMS) combined with high-density electroencephalography (EEG). We demonstrated that with development, the excitability of the motor system increases, the TMS-evoked EEG waveform increases in complexity, the magnitude of induced activation decreases, and signal spreading increases. Furthermore, the phase of the oscillatory response to TMS becomes less consistent with age. These changes parallel an improvement in manual dexterity and may reflect developmental changes in functional connectivity.","tags":null,"title":"Development of cortical motor circuits between childhood and adulthood: A navigated TMS-HdEEG study","type":"publication"},{"authors":["M.

RS has been demonstrated in motor-evoked potentials (MEPs) induced with transcranial magnetic stimulation (TMS). Here, we investigated the effect of inter-train interval (ITI) on the induction of RS of MEPs with the attempt to optimize the investigative protocols. Trains of TMS pulses, targeted to the primary motor cortex by neuronavigation, were applied at a stimulation intensity of 120% of the resting motor threshold. The stimulus trains included either four or twenty pulses with an inter-stimulus interval (ISI) of 1 s. The ITI was here defined as the interval between the last pulse in a train and the first pulse in the next train; the ITIs used here were 1, 3, 4, 6, 7, 12, and 17 s. RS was observed with all ITIs except with the ITI of 1 s, in which the ITI was equal to ISI. RS was more pronounced with longer ITIs. Shorter ITIs may not allow sufficient time for a return to baseline. RS may reflect a startle-like response to the first pulse of a train followed by habituation. Longer ITIs may allow more recovery time and in turn demonstrate greater RS. Our results indicate that RS can be studied with confidence at relatively short ITIs of 6 s and above.","tags":null,"title":"Effect of inter-train interval on the induction of repetition suppression of motor-evoked potentials using transcranial magnetic stimulation","type":"publication"},{"authors":["E.

The responses are affected by the orientation of the stimulated neurons with respect to the direction of the TMS-induced electric field. Therefore, besides being a functional imaging tool, TMS may potentially assess the local structural properties. Yet, TMS has not been used for this purpose. **NEW METHOD**: A novel principle to evaluate the relation between function and structure of the motor cortex is presented. This functional anisotropy is evaluated by an anisotropy index (AI), based on motor evoked potential amplitudes induced with different TMS coil orientations, i.e. different electric field directions at a cortical target. To compare the AI with anatomical anisotropy in an explorative manner, diffusion tensor imaging-derived fractional anisotropy (FA) was estimated at different depths near the stimulation site. **RESULTS**:  AI correlated inversely with cortical excitability through the TMS-induced electric field at motor threshold level. Further, there was a trend of negative correlation between AI and FA. **COMPARISON WITH EXISTING METHODS**:  None of the existing methods alone can detect the relationship between direct motor cortex activation and local neuronal structure. **CONCLUSIONS**:  The AI appears to provide information on the functional neuronal anisotropy of the motor cortex by coupling neurophysiology and neuroanatomy within the stimulated cortical region. The AI could prove useful in the evaluation of neurological disorders and traumas involving concurrent structural and functional changes in the motor cortex. Further studies on patients are needed to confirm the usability of AI.","tags":null,"title":"Functional neuronal anisotropy assessed with neuronavigated transcranial magnetic stimulation","type":"publication"},{"authors":["M.

According to the principles of electromagnetism and electrophysiology, TMS activates those neurons that are suitably oriented with respect to the TMS-induced electric field. We hypothesized that TMS could potentially be able to evaluate the neuronal structure, although until now, this putative application has not been exploited. We have developed a TMS-based method to evaluate the function and structure of the motor cortex concurrently in a quantitative manner. This method produced a measure, the anisotropy index (AI), which is based on the motor-evoked potentials induced at different coil orientations. The AI was demonstrated to exhibit an association with both motor cortex excitability and neuronal structure. In the present study, we evaluated the repeatability (intrasession and intersession) of AI in three consecutive measurements. In addition, we studied the repeatability of the optimal coil angle in inducing motor-evoked potentials. Two of the measurements were conducted on the same stimulation target and the third on a remapped target. The coefficient of repeatability of the AI was 0.022 for intrasession and 0.040 for intersession assessments. For the optimal stimulation angle, the coefficients of repeatability were 3.7° and 5.1°, respectively. Both the AI and the optimal stimulation angle demonstrated good repeatability (Cronbach's α0.760). In conclusion, the results indicate that the AI can provide a reliable estimation of local functional anisotropy changes under conditions affecting the cortex, such as during stroke or focal dysplasia.","tags":null,"title":"Repeatability of functional anisotropy in navigated transcranial magnetic stimulation--coil-orientation versus response","type":"publication"},{"authors":["E.

The MEP latency, which is a more stable parameter than the MEP amplitude, has not so far been utilized in motor mapping. The latency, however, may provide information about the stress in damaged motor pathways, e.g. compression by tumors, which cannot be observed from the MEP amplitudes. Thus, inclusion of this parameter could add valuable information to the presently used technique of MEP amplitude mapping. In this study, the functional cortical representations of first dorsal interosseous (FDI), abductor pollicis brevis (APB) and abductor digiti minimi (ADM) muscles were mapped in both hemispheres of ten healthy righthanded volunteers. The cortical muscle representations were evaluated by the area and centre of gravity (CoG) by using MEP amplitudes and latencies. As expected, the latency and amplitude CoGs were congruent and were located in the centre of the maps but in a few subjects, instead of a single centre, several loci with short latencies were observed. In conclusion, MEP latencies may be useful in distinguishing the cortical representation areas with the most direct pathways from those pathways with prolonged latencies.

The aim was to reduce the characteristic inter-individual variation in SP measurements in healthy population to improve the sensitivity of such measurements. **METHODS**: The cortical representation area of the right hand musculature of 12 healthy subjects was stimulated with navigated TMS with varying stimulating intensities. Subsequently, the individual SPTs for eliciting SPs of 20, 30, and 50ms in duration were determined from the input-output characteristics. **RESULTS**: While SPT for 20 and 50ms SPs differed from rMT, the SPT for 30ms was similar to rMT. Nevertheless, the inter-individual variation in SP duration was reduced significantly at 120% of SPT30 when compared with SP durations obtained at 120% of rMT. **CONCLUSIONS**: Inter-individual variation in the SP duration decreases when applying TMS at stimulation intensities normalized to the individual SPTs instead to the rMT. This makes the SP duration more specific to inhibition and less affected by changes in cortical excitability. **SIGNIFICANCE**: Use of individual SPTs may improve the sensitivity of the SP measures in studies with inter-individual design.","tags":null,"title":"On the estimation of silent period thresholds in transcranial magnetic stimulation","type":"publication"},{"authors":["P.

The cSP is a measure of cortical inhibition and is believed to represent inhibitory interneuron effects on excited motor cortical areas. Several pathological conditions and pharmacological manipulations induce changes to cSP duration indicating alterations in intracortical inhibition. At present, it is common to manually analyse the cSP duration from measured EMG. However, to avoid inter-examiner effects on cSP interpretation and detection, as well as to allow for quick measurement online, automated routine would be preferable. In this study, we evaluate the feasibility of a straight-forward cSP detection routine based on analysing the rectified first derivative of the EMG signal following TMS. Previously measured cSPs of 54 healthy subjects were reanalysed manually by two of the authors and using the automated routine. Furthermore, we recruited one subject for whom the cSPs were induced with several stimulation intensities, and those cSPs were analysed manually by two of the authors as well as using the automated routine. We found that cSPs were detected correctly by the automated cSP detection routine, and agreement with manually analysed subject-specific mean cSPs was excellent (ICC=0.992, p","tags":null,"title":"Feasibility of automated analysis and inter-examiner variability of cortical silent period induced by transcranial magnetic stimulation","type":"publication"},{"authors":null,"categories":null,"content":" #title = \u0026ldquo;Privacy Policy\u0026rdquo; # #date = 2018-06-28T00:00:00 #draft = true #share = false #\n[header] image = \u0026ldquo;\u0026rdquo; caption = \u0026ldquo;\u0026rdquo; #+++ # #\u0026hellip;\n","date":-62135596800,"expirydate":-62135596800,"kind":"page","lang":"en","lastmod":-62135596800,"objectID":"18d05a63a1c8d7ed973cc51838494e41","permalink":"https://www.elisakallioniemi.com/privacy/","publishdate":"0001-01-01T00:00:00Z","relpermalink":"/privacy/","section":"","summary":"#title = \u0026ldquo;Privacy Policy\u0026rdquo; # #date = 2018-06-28T00:00:00 #draft = true #share = false #\n[header] image = \u0026ldquo;\u0026rdquo; caption = \u0026ldquo;\u0026rdquo; #+++ # #\u0026hellip;","tags":null,"title":"","type":"page"},{"authors":null,"categories":null,"content":" Welcome to Slides Academic\nFeatures  Efficiently write slides in Markdown 3-in-1: Create, Present, and Publish your slides Supports speaker notes Mobile friendly slides  Controls  Next: Right Arrow or Space Previous: Left Arrow Start: Home Finish: End Overview: Esc Speaker notes: S Fullscreen: F Zoom: Alt + Click PDF Export: E  Code Highlighting Inline code: variable\nCode block:\nporridge = \u0026quot;blueberry\u0026quot; if porridge == \u0026quot;blueberry\u0026quot;: print(\u0026quot;Eating...\u0026quot;)  Math In-line math: $x + y = z$\nBlock math:\n$$ f\\left( x \\right) = \\;\\frac{{2\\left( {x + 4} \\right)\\left( {x - 4} \\right)}}{{\\left( {x + 4} \\right)\\left( {x + 1} \\right)}} $$\nFragments Make content appear incrementally\n{{% fragment %}} One {{% /fragment %}} {{% fragment %}} **Two** {{% /fragment %}} {{% fragment %}} Three {{% /fragment %}}  Press Space to play!\nOne  Two  Three \nA fragment can accept two optional parameters:\n class: use a custom style (requires definition in custom CSS) weight: sets the order in which a fragment appears  Speaker Notes Add speaker notes to your presentation\n{{% speaker_note %}} - Only the speaker can read these notes - Press `S` key to view {{% /speaker_note %}}  Press the S key to view the speaker notes!\n Only the speaker can read these notes Press S key to view   Themes  black: Black background, white text, blue links (default) white: White background, black text, blue links league: Gray background, white text, blue links beige: Beige background, dark text, brown links sky: Blue background, thin dark text, blue links   night: Black background, thick white text, orange links serif: Cappuccino background, gray text, brown links simple: White background, black text, blue links solarized: Cream-colored background, dark green text, blue links  Custom Slide Customize the slide style and background\n{{\u0026lt; slide background-image=\u0026quot;/img/boards.jpg\u0026quot; \u0026gt;}} {{\u0026lt; slide background-color=\u0026quot;#0000FF\u0026quot; \u0026gt;}} {{\u0026lt; slide class=\u0026quot;my-style\u0026quot; \u0026gt;}}  Custom CSS Example Let\u0026rsquo;s make headers navy colored.\nCreate assets/css/reveal_custom.css with:\n.reveal section h1, .reveal section h2, .reveal section h3 { color: navy; }  Questions?
